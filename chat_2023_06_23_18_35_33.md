The code looks fine, but if you want to make it cleaner and more readable, you can try the following:

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-img-top" data-pro-id="<?php echo $product_id ?>">
    <img class="card-img-top-b" src="./upload/product/<?php echo $product_image1; ?>" alt="Card image cap">
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text"><?php echo $product_name; ?></p>
    <p class="card-text">
      <b style="text-decoration: line-through; opacity:0.9; font-size:13px;">$<?php echo $product_old_price; ?></b>
      <b>$<?php echo $response->result?></b>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

In this updated code, I wrapped the entire card in a div with the class "card", which is a Bootstrap class used for styling cards. I also added a hyphen between "pro" and "id" in the "data-proId" attribute to make it more readable. Additionally, I added some whitespace and indentation to make the code easier to read.
