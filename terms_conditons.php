                                        5. RIGHTS OF E-tradespace.COM

                                        5.1 Auction Glitches. E-tradespace.com will offer 100% risk free auctions, except when a technical glitch prevents that from
                                        happening. In such a case, E-tradespace.com reserves the right to stop, restart, or cancel any auction at any time, including
                                        before, during and after. Any and all funds received during a glitch auction, will be returned by E-tradespace.com to the 
                                        customer if no merchandise is shipped. It is in the best interest of all bidders to print a copy or write down the
                                        listing number of each auction. In the case your auction was affected by a glitch, without the listing number 
                                        there will be no way to investigate the situation. It is the sole responsibility of the user to maintain the 
                                        auction listing number(s).

                                        5.2 Breach. Without limiting other remedies, E-tradespace.com may immediately issue a warning, temporarily suspend, 
                                        indefinitely suspend or terminate your access to the Site and refuse to provide services to you: (a) if you breach 
                                        this User Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference; (b) if E-tradespace.com is unable to verify or authenticate
                                        any information you provide to E-tradespace.com; or (c) if E-tradespace.com believes that your actions may cause legal liability for
                                        you, other E-tradespace.com users, or E-tradespace.com.

                                        5.3 Termination. E-tradespace.com may terminate this Agreement or your access to the Site at any time in the event of any 
                                        conduct by you which E-tradespace.com, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable.

                                        6. BIDDING TERMS

                                        6.1 Your Bid Or Offer To Buy Is Your Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that a bid or a request to buy any Product 
                                        is a legal offer to buy the Product. Once E-tradespace.com accepts your offer, you are obligated to complete the transaction 
                                        as accepted by E-tradespace.com. Accordingly, when you bid on a Product on E-tradespace.com, you enter a legally binding contract in 
                                        which you express intent to purchase the Product at the proposed bid price. Failure to do so in a timely manner will 
                                        result in termination of your E-tradespace.com membership and other actions taken by E-tradespace.com to enforce your obligations. 
                                        You acknowledge that not fulfilling these obligations may be legally actionable.

                                        6.2 First Time Users. First time customers will be required to pay for their first five items that they bid on and win.
                                        Bidding privileges will be restricted until payment is made. After the first transaction is officially completed, 
                                        customers will be able to bid freely on other items. Until such time, customers will not be able to make use of the 
                                        E-tradespace.com auto-bid feature.

                                        6.3 Listing Page. Each Product has a Listing Page, which sets forth the Products description and additional Checkout 
                                        Terms, if applicable. You are responsible to read the Listing Page, and your submission of a bid to buy a Product 
                                        constitutes your agreement that you have read and you understand the Listing Page and any Checkout Terms.

                                        6.4 Bid Increment Rules

                                        (a) Whole Dollar Increments. Each proposed purchase price in each bid (a Bid Amount) to buy a Product is in whole 
                                        dollar amounts. Any Bid amount not placed in whole dollar increments will be invalid and not accepted.

                                        (b) Minimum Bid Increase. Your Bid Amount has to exceed the current highest bid by at least the Minimum Bid Increase.
                                         The Minimum Bid Increase is $1.00 USD.

                                        (c) Automatic Bid Increments. For your convenience, E-tradespace.com automatically sets each of your next Bid Amounts by 
                                        adding the applicable Minimum Bid Increase to the current Bid Amount. YOU MAY ALSO SET YOUR DESIRED BID AMOUNT 
                                        MANUALLY, WITHOUT THE AID OF THE E-tradespace.COM AUTOMATIC BID INCREASE IF GREATER THAN THE APPLICABLE MINIMUM BID AMOUNT 
                                        INCREASE.

                                        6.5 No Bid Shilling or Fraud. Bid shilling occurs when someone bids on a Product for the sole purpose of driving up 
                                        the price and is prohibited. Any evidence of bid shilling on a Product is a breach of this Agreement and warrants 
                                        immediate termination of membership.

                                        6.6 Retracting Your Bid. Once you have submitted a bid to purchase any Product, it cannot be retracted unless you made
                                        an obvious typographical error when placing a bid. For clarification, a bid placed on another, similar Product, 
                                        changing your mind, or inability to pay for the Product is not grounds to retract a bid or to cancel your agreement 
                                        to purchase a Product. To retract a confirmed bid, you need to contact Customer Service with your request and include
                                        the Product listing number and a valid explanation.

                                        6.7 Submission of the Highest Bid and Your Payment Obligation. When you have submitted the highest Bid Amount during 
                                        the selling period of a Product, you will receive an e-mail notifying you that you have submitted the highest Bid 
                                        Amount - you will have two (2) days thereafter to pay for your Product(s) at that highest Bid Amount. You are 
                                        responsible for keeping track of all of your highest Bid Amounts. No extensions on these two (2) days will be given.

                                        7. BIDDING TOOLS

                                        7.2 Auto-bid System. Our Auto-bid System will automatically place bids on your behalf on Products up to your maximum 
                                        Bid Amount. Your election to use the Auto-bid System is your offer to purchase the applicable Product at the highest 
                                        Bid Amount designated by you and a legal contract between you and E-tradespace.com. If your highest bid amount is the winning 
                                        bid, you agree to comply with your obligations under that contract to buy the Product from E-tradespace.com. An Auto-bid 
                                        placed on a Product or Bids that have already been placed by the Auto-bid System may not be canceled.

                                        been set. Once the minimum Reserve Price is met, the highest bidder will win the item once the auction closes. Each
